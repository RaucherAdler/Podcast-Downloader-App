RSS Feed Application by R. Adler v3.2 12/22/20

# About 
The purpose of this application is to parse RSS Feeds
 and download associated files simply within the 
 terminal. As of now it is only meant for 
 podcasts and other audio. This is just a small side-project 
 i've worked on for a while now mainly for my own usage. 
 If you come across any issue or want more information, 
 feel free to reach out to me.

# From Source:
- Check that you have the following:
    - [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
    - [Feedparser](https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser)
- Then run `python main.py` in your terminal.

## Note:
If you are having issues with file paths / your saved
RSS Feeds, there are two text files included with this 
program of which you can manually edit if needed.
As of now there are a couple issues I have yet to fix 
due to a shift in my focuses towards other projects, so
do keep in mind it isn't perfect.
