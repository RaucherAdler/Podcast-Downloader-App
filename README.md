RSS Feed Application by R. Adler V.2.0 8/24/20

# About 
The purpose of this application is to parse RSS Feeds
 and download associated files simply within the 
 terminal. As of now it is only meant for 
 podcasts and other audio. Future versions may allow 
 for news/video feeds. This is just a small side-project 
 i've worked on for a while now mainly for my own usage. 
 If you come across any issue or want more information, 
 feel free to reach out to me.

## For Source (main.py):
-In order to run source Python code, you must have
 an up to date version of Python 3.X as well as
the required dependencies:
    -Feedparser
    -urllib
    -linecache
    -sys
    -os
    -threading
-Then run `python main.py` in your terminal.

## Otherwise:
-in dristribution folder, there should be an 
executable file for your system.

## Note:
If you are having issues with file paths / your saved
RSS Feeds, there are two text files included with this 
program of which you can manually edit if needed.
