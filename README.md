# About
The purpose of this application is to parse RSS Feeds and download associated files within the terminal. As of now it is only meant for podcast feeds.\
If you come across any issue or want more information, feel free to reach out to me.

# Usage:
To run, run `python main.py` in your terminal in the project's directory. I recommend wrapping this in a script and putting that in your path.\
